# linuxRstuff
a collection of random scripts and notes that help R-Users working in Linux. I have NO idea what the hell I'm doing... only gain insight by headbutting problems till they break... so pull-requests, comments, issues are welcome.

## Scripts:
For all of these scripts, either clone the folder into your server (probably easiest), or `touch` a new file, then edit that file and drop the code in.

**but no matter what you do** Remember to make the file executable by using `chmod 777 filename` *. You can then jump into the folder containing these files and run it like this: `./file.sh`

\* 777 gives EVERYBODY on the server the right to edit your file is generally seen as bad practice. Therefore this advice is more suited for sole data scientists or a very small team, not for large teams or production code.

 - **Rinstaller.sh** - create a file like this in your server and use it to install packages. That way, the packages will be available for all users.
  - **chek.sh** - a file that you can use to see if an R script is running... if it's running, then do nothing... if it's NOT running, then it assigns the working directory, and restarts the file.
  - **forUpdates.sh** - Use this file when the server requires updates... it first updates, then upgrades, tehn updates the distro(? - I think), then it autoremoves stuff that's no longer required, then autocleans. I'm debating throwing a `reboot` in there... prolly shouldn't... but it would be convenient. Anyway, this is how you grab all that stuff in the correct order. I copypasted this from somewhere but can't find it anymore... if anyone knows where I stole it from pls raise an issue and I'll add the source.

## Tips:

Find files anywhere (starting from current location `sudo find . -name "*.fileExtension"` (or whatevs))

### Run stuff on the server

You can either run stuff on a schedule, or design a job that will make it run continuously. To set up jobs on a schedule, use the `[crontab](https://crontab.guru/)`. 

To view the crontab, list it with `crontab -l`, and to edit it, go with `crontab -e`. Note. DO NOT `sudo crontab -e` or you'll create a job w/ sudo permissions which is a bit dangerous.

#### Set up R cron jobs like this:
`40 * * * * Rscript "path/file.R" >> /home/YourLinuxUsername/NewLogger.log 2>&1`

This way you'll have a log file that outputs the contents of each run (errors and results). Or you could build a bashfile for more complex logging (see https://github.com/DataStrategist/amitFuncs).

#### Set up a linux service

If we want something to be running continuously and runs like a linux service itself, we can create a service. Follow these steps.

1. create the service file: `sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/SERVICENAME.service`
2. edit it: `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/SERVICENAME.service`

Fill the file w/ these contents (where SERVICENAME is how you'd like to refer to this "job", PATH_TO_R_SCRIPT is the path to the script you want to run, and SCRIPT_TO_RUN is the name of the script inside PATH_TO_R_SCRIPT you'd like to run.

```
[Unit]
Description=SERVICENAME

[Service]
Type=simple
User=amit
ExecStart=/usr/bin/Rscript "/PATH_TO_R_SCRIPT/SCRIPT_TO_RUN.R"
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory= /PATH_TO_R_SCRIPT/
Environment="LANG=en_US.UTF-8"


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Where each part does this:

 - **Description** is what the thingie does
 - **Type** says how to run it, and ‚Äúsimple‚Äù is the default‚Ä¶ but check the documentation if u wanna do something more fancy
 - **User** this defines what user is running the service. This is a bit of extra insurance, in case you installed a package as a yourself and not as a superuser (which is the correct way)
 - **ExecStart** is the command to run
 - **Restart** by specifying this to ‚Äúalways‚Äù, if the script ever goes down, it‚Äôll automatically restart and start scraping again! üôÇ Super cool, no? WARNING: Not sure about whether this can cause trouble‚Ä¶ if twitter is for some reason pissed off and doesn‚Äôt want to serve tweets to you anymore, not sure if CONSTANTLY restarting this could get you in trouble. If I get banned, I‚Äôll letchu know‚Ä¶ stay tuned)
 - **WorkingDirectory** This part is where the magic happens. Remember earlier on we were worried and worried about HOW to pass the working directory to the R script? This is how!! Now we don‚Äôt have to worry about paths on the server anymore!
 - **Environment** is the language
 - **WantedBy** I have no idea what this does and don‚Äôt care because it works!


 3. Now we need to restart the daemon that picks up services? `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
 4. Now start the service!! `sudo systemctl start SERVICENAME`
 5. Now your service is running! You can check the status of it using: `systemctl status SERVICENAME.service`





## User stuff

`cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd` display all users

`useradd x` add a user called x. Might have to sudo

`sudo adduser x --force-badname` is the better prefered way to do it... if you do the other way RStudio might be upset.

`passwd x` change the password for x

`gpasswd -a x sudo` Add user to sudo group

`sudo chown -R x:y /FOLDER` Transfer ownership a file/folder to user `x` and/or group `y` CAREFUL!

`sudo groupadd y` Add a group

`sudo usermod -aG y x` add user `x` to group `y`



## Port stuff
If you have [ufw](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/firewall.html) installed, to open or close a port:

`sudo ufw allow XXX` (or `deny`)

to list open ports

`netstat -tulnp | grep "LISTEN"` 

## Locale stuff:

`sudo locale-gen en_US` Set a locale. Sometimes for some reason this needs to be manually edited in a few other places... for example: 

`sudo nano /etc/default/locale` and `sudo nano /etc/environment`, and then finally, you have the big one `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales`.

After you're done, you need to `sudo reboot`. Then you can check your new stuff using `locale` or `env`.


## START STOP RESTART COMMANDS

```
sudo systemctl status shiny-server
sudo systemctl stop shiny-server
sudo systemctl start shiny-server
sudo systemctl restart shiny-server
sudo systemctl status shiny-server
```

```
sudo rstudio-server status
sudo rstudio-server start
sudo rstudio-server stop
sudo rstudio-server restart
```

## ShinyServer stuff

`sudo nano /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf` Shortcut to edit shiny's config folder

`tail -n 20 /var/log/shiny-server.log` see last 20 lines of the shiny-server log. If you want to see the logs for the individual apps, these are in `cd /var/log/shiny-server/` and then dig around.

`/etc/shiny-server/passwd` is the location to create new Shiny users

## Write access:
`sudo chmod -R 750 FileOrFolder`

where the numbers mean:4 stands for "read",2 stands for "write",1 stands for "execute", and0 stands for "no permission.". Add them up to come up w/ the number. The three numbers stand for "user", "group", and "other". the `-R` means Recursive (as in the case of a folder). Read more [here](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm): 

## Database stuff
To see more about installing ODBC sources in a db, check out [my blog article](http://amitkohli.com/how-to-move-odbc-dsn-information-from-one-computer-to-another/).

`odbcinst -s -q` Checks whether an ODBC Source has been installed or not
`odbcinst -d -q` Shows the actual ODBC sources

`isql -v mydsn myusername mypassword` Establishes a connection to the db (as a minimum test to see if all the credentials work).

## Setting up links
In order to sync all files from one folder to the other, you need to set up a symlink (use case is for example to get data to copy into a folder that the dropbox daemon is watching.

`ln -s SOURCE_FOLDER FINAL_FOLDER`

## Git stuff
There's so much to say... let's keep it simple:

`sudo git stash` - Just bulldoze whatever local changes... a bit safer than the following option. Do this when you have a script running 
on the server that may have modified some tracked output files.... and you don't really want to deal with it.

`sudo git reset --hard` - Goes back to the last commit, this demolishes all local changes with no record. Careful!

When you have a merge conflict:

`git status` to see what's conflicting, and then:
`git checkout --ours FILE.html` to accept the new change... or `theirs` to accept the server version. 

If your credentials get forgotten or corrupted, you should first clear credentials, and then re-cache them:

`git credential-cache exit`

`git config --global credential.helper cache`

`git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 28800'` (this is 8 hrs)

To clean up your environment:

`git remote prune origin` will delete all unused branches on your remote (assuming it's called origin)
`git branch --merged | egrep -v "(^\*|master|dev)" | xargs git branch -d` will delete all your useless local branches.

If you ever commit something by accident that you want removed from the git record (for example, some files in the `.Rproj.user` folder,), try one of these:

```
cd .Rproj.user/
git rm --cached -R .
cd ..
git rm --cached -r .Rproj.user
```

## Dropbox
Following the instructions [here](https://www.dropbox.com/en_GB/install-linux) are pretty painless... except if you want to perform a selective sync. In that case, make sure you install the `dropbox.py` they recommend, and keep in mind these two commands:

`~/utils/dropbox.py exclude add *`      (exclude EVERYTHING from sync)

`~/utils/dropbox.py exclude remove DIR` (remove DIR from exclusion list)

## Web srvr stuff
 If you have lighttpd as a web server... 

`/etc/init.d/lighttpd stop`
 
 `/etc/init.d/lighttpd start`
 
 ... or nginx
 
 `nginx -V` To see general configuarion options, like who installed, where etc. For me:
 
   `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to edit configuration
   `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` for other configuration stuff
   
   `/usr/share/nginx ` thinks it's the site, but it might be here: `/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html`
   
   `/var/log/nginx/access.log` log file
  
 To enable nginx basic password protection (not sure if all of this is necessary, but it does appear to be sufficient):
 
 ```
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
  server_name localhost;
  auth_basic "Restricted Content";
  auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
```

`sudo service nginx restart` restart

## System Resources stuff

To see how much memory and swap space you have available you can type `top` but it's much better if you install and then run `htop`.

To see how much hard drive room you have you can type:

`df -h`

Or to have more details, 

`sudo ncdu /`

To for example single out Specific items we can also combine with `awk` command... so for example, to get size, % used and available of `sda2`, we can type:

`df -hl | awk '/sda2/{print $2,$5,$4}'`

The `sudo` and the `/` are important otherwise it'll only give you the space allocation of the current folder. I found that some packages really abuse the `/tmp` file, but it's not necessary to use some hardcore tmp cleaner, it's enough to reboot the server.

Another way is to get yourself to `/` and then type `sudo du -h --max-depth=1` to see the biggest culprits

And here is a code block to show how much memory, swap space etc you have:

```
AVDGcc::createSystemHealthButtons()
memSwap <- system("vmstat -s", intern = TRUE)
  FreeMem <- as.numeric(gsub("\\D", "", grep("free memory", memSwap, value = TRUE)))
  TotMem <- as.numeric(gsub("\\D", "", grep("total memory", memSwap, value = TRUE)))
  MemPer <- round(FreeMem / TotMem * 100, 1)
  MemPer <- TileMaker::solo_gradient_box(MemPer, paste(MemPer, "% mem av (LEAP)", sep = ""), target = 100,
                              thresholdHigh = 50, thresholdLow = 10, hide_value = TRUE,
                              textModifier = "span")

  FreeSw <- as.numeric(gsub("\\D", "", grep("free swap", memSwap, value = TRUE)))
  TotSw <- as.numeric(gsub("\\D", "", grep("total swap", memSwap, value = TRUE)))
  SwPer <- round(FreeSw / TotSw * 100, 1)
  SwPer <- solo_gradient_box(SwPer, paste(SwPer, "% swap av (LEAP)", sep = ""), target = 100,
                             thresholdHigh = 50, thresholdLow = 10, hide_value = TRUE,
                             textModifier = "span")
  SpaceUsed <- system("df -hl | awk '/sda1/{print $5}'", intern = TRUE) %>%
    gsub("%", "", x = .) %>%
    as.numeric()
  SpPer <- solo_gradient_box(SpaceUsed, paste(SpaceUsed, "% HD space used (LEAP)", sep = ""), target = 0,
                             thresholdHigh = 25, thresholdLow = 50, hide_value = TRUE,
                             textModifier = "span")

  SystemButtons <- TileMaker::div_maker(subtitle = "System Health", textModifier = "p",
                            MemPer,
                            SwPer,
                            SpPer)
```

## Is your process running

Once you have stuff running on the server, you can check to see if it's runnning. A few ways:

`htop` and then sort by STATE (by pressing F6). Everything you see w/ an `R` is running, `S` is stopped.

`sudo ps aux | grep STUFF` will check for the status of `STUFF` to see if its running or not. 

## copying stuff to/from the server

Upload the file yourFile.xyz to your home directory on the VM

`scp yourFile.xyz username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/.`
 
Upload the folder yourFolder to your home directory on the VM

`scp -r yourFolder username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/.`

Download the file ~/yourFile.xyz to your home directory on your computer

`scp username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/yourFile.xyz ~/.`
 
Download the folder yourFolder to your home directory on your computer

`scp -r username@cerzheprd03.its.auckland.ac.nz:~/yourFolder ~/.`

## Setup

So installing on a fresh install is annoying. I think this is the best way to do it.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev

## and now libraries
##  inside sudo R
install.packages("readr", dependencies=TRUE, INSTALL_opts = c('--no-lock'))
## or outside be like:
sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages("tidyverse")'
```

## Gargle stuff

 - If the credentials get messed up, delete the cached credentials here: `~/.R/gargle/gargle-oauth`
 - To see more about gargle errors, use `options(gargle_quiet = FALSE)`
 - `sheets_deauth()`
 - To cache the credential, we have to use `googledrive::drive_auth(email = "av.dbbuddy@gmail.com", use_oob = T)`, after which non-interactive authentication should work.
 - other than the normal problem page, you can also refer to this https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/auth-from-web.html#but-i-didnt-need-oob-yesterday, where you'll see: `sudo lsof -i :1410` will show "zombie" jobs.
